        //The flatMap() method is a higher-order function in JavaScript that is available on arrays. It is used to transform each element of an array into a new value or a new array, based on a provided function, and returns a new flattened array with the transformed values.

        const books = [  {title: 'The Alchemist', authors: ['Paulo Coelho']},
            {title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', authors: ['J.D. Salinger']},
            {title: 'The Great Gatsby', authors: ['F. Scott Fitzgerald']},
            {title: 'The Hobbit', authors: ['J.R.R. Tolkien']},
            {title: 'The Lord of the Rings', authors: ['J.R.R. Tolkien']}
