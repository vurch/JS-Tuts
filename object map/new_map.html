        // Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that Map allows keys of any type.
        
        //Object is similar to Mapâ€”both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key.

        // You can create a Map by passing an Array to the new Map() constructor:
        const fruits = new Map([
        ["apples", 500],
        ["bananas", 300],
        ["oranges", 200]
        ]);

        console.log( fruits );
