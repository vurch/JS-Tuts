        /*
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree-like structure, with each element of the page represented as a node in the tree.

            The DOM provides a way for programs to access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page, allowing for dynamic and interactive web pages. Using the DOM, programs can add or remove elements from a page, change the content of existing elements, and respond to user events like mouse clicks and key presses.

            The DOM is an essential component of modern web development, and it is supported by all major web browsers. Web developers can access the DOM through JavaScript, which provides a rich set of APIs for interacting with the document tree.

            In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
