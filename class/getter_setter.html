        Classes also allows you to use getters and setters.
        It can be smart to use getters and setters for your properties, especially if you want to do something special with the value before returning them, or before you set them.
        To add getters and setters in the class, use the get and set keywords.
        Even if the getter is a method, you do not use parentheses when you want to get the property value.
